So which is better, wxPython or Tkinter?

Same program, same database, same language, different GUI.

Choose for yourself what feels best to you.

I have created two folders for the two versions. To launch the ordnance you have to run the file called northwind.py present in the respective folders, which means that if you are on Windows you can launch northwind.py file using python idle directly, or by running it from the command line, whereas if you are on linux, from where I write you can launch it from the shell making it executable after running something like this chmod +x northwind.py and then ./northwind
